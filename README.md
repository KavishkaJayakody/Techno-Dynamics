This project was done for the semester robotics project (EN2533 UoM). The Tasks were mainly based on line following, box manipulation, barcode reading, maze solving ect. The code follows a modular architecture.
Although our robot failed to complete the tasks(lack of cooperation by the team members) my code had all the functionalities needed to complete the task with a reasonably good accuracy.
The robot class includs the basic functionality of the robot while all the other classes includes the supporting functions running in the background and the foreground to give the intended outputs.
